# 1. Find the difference between the lowest and highest numbers

You are going to be an array of integers. Your job is to return an integer which is the difference between the highest and lowest integers in the array.

### Examples:
```
[3,1,7] => 6
```
```
[1721, 979, 366, 299, 675, 1456] => 1422
```
### Extension
For each integer in the array, reorder the digits in ascending order before finding the difference between the lowest and highest.
```
[1721, 979, 366, 299, 675, 1456] => 1157
```

# 2. # Build a React component that has random dice rolls

A user should see
- a title “Dice Roll App”, and a button to click
- three different random numbers from 1-6 every time they click the button.

No styling needed for this task.

### Extension
- When the number is a 6, a 🔥 emoji should be displayed next to the number
- When the number is a 1, a 😭 emoji should be displayed next to the number
