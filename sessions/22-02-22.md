# 1. Character Count

You are going to be a string. Your job is to return the count of each character in the string, in alphabetical order

### Examples:
```
"edward" => {
  "a": 1,
  "d": 2,
  "e": 1,
  "r": 1,
  "w": 1,
}
```
```
"" => {
}
```

# 2. Double the array!

You are going to be given an array of elements. Your job is to return an array which has duplicated each element

### Examples:
```
[1,2] => [1, 1, 2, 2]
```
```
['a', 'b'] => ['a', 'a', 'b', 'b']
```

### Extension
```js
const array = ['a', 'b']
array.doubleUp() // => ['a', 'a', 'b', 'b']
```
