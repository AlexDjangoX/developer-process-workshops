# 2. Consuming an API

Create a simple non-styled webpage and make a request to the GitHub API to retrieve a list of **up to 100** your repositories (default request returns 30 repos). Then display all the repository names on the page.

### Extension

- Order the list (DESC) by how many stars they have.
- Add the main repository language next to the name.
