# Developer Process Workshops



#### What are they?
A weekly a session focused on writing short programs under observation. The goal is to have a fun session writing and reviewing the process of writing code together -> to help you improve. If you've had a mock technical interview with a member of the teaching team, it will be similar to this experience.

#### How do I participate?
Check out the `#tech-skills` channel on Discord or message a member of the Teaching team.

#### What's involved?

- **Intro:** 5mins
- **Main:** 50mins - Participants will pair up and take turns for 25 mins each implementing requirement(s) for a low-complexity JavaScript exercise (server-side and browser-side). You'll practice coding under observation.
- **Wrapup:** 5mins - we'll review the requirements as a group.

#### What will I get out of it?
- Practice writing code under observation (similar to some mock tech interviews)
- A reflection upon your process of taking requirements and implementing them

#### Where can I find the exercises from past sessions?
Have a look here at the [Session Archive](./sessions)

#### Can I improve my process outside of these workshops?
Absolutely. To simulate the observation, use screen-recording software to record yourself tackling a task for a similar period of time.

You are encouraged to review it to identify areas of improvement. If you want more feedback please upload the recording to YouTube and share the link with a member of the teaching team for them to review.
